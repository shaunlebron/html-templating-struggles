So the realization of looking at these different templating languages is that
they were created on the principle of indentation to achieve simple appearance,
and then tried fitting the language with special functions and sugars for

ClojureScript (Lisp) started from the first principles of building a flexible
language that can represent the nature of our code as 

We don't focus on parentheses when we're reading code, we see the indentation.
Doing away with these parentheses would mean the language would lose many of
the aforementioned properties. And it's an engineers practice to weigh and
balance properties like this.


In fact, Lisp was only intended as an internal notation for the compiler, but when its
nicer [M-expression] sugar was delayed, something happened-- everyone started
preferring the consistency and power of the original notation.

safety net:
- flexible
- consistent
- clear
- strong
- ugly?

There is no perfect solution, something has to give.


### NOTES

Dismissing Lisp in this situation is like seeing the head of the iceberg,

Excessive parentheses is a strong force against the ClojureScript newcomer,
and this fear is further exacerbated by a seeming lack of popularity, confirming
the fear and discouraging learning.

With that in mind, the onus of educators is to combat these natural aversions
by creating stepping stones of familiar ideas.  That is the purpose of this
article.


to stop fighting for beauty, and accept that representing our code as the data
that it is affords us these benefits, and that coupled with stockholm syndrome
experienced in every langauge means that its appearance won't even bother
us anymore.

|          | PROS        | CONS         |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| JS       | Familiar    | but Limiting |  <--- don't know what you're missing?
| Jade/JSX |             |              |      (or do you... look at JSX, look at Jade, these are things that fundamentally should not exist, we don't invent new technologies for general purpose operations.
|----------|-------------|--------------|       separation of concerns is not about different technologies)
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| CLJS     | Power       | Unfamiliar   |  <--- or not just unfamiliar but maybe ugly?
|          | Consistency |              |       (stockholm syndrome?)
|          | Simple      |              |

So, given that the stockholm syndrome makes us look past most of the CONS of
any language, which language would you measure to be better?

|          | PROS        | CONS         |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| JS       | Familiar    | but Limiting |
| Jade/JSX | Popular     |              |  <--- Popular, big community, big support
|----------|-------------|--------------|
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| CLJS     | Power       | Unfamiliar   |
|          | Consistency | Unpopular    |  <--- Smaller community
|          | Simple      |              |

But we left out a column, and this is popularity:


Keeping them balance is a job well performed by any editor, especially with
"paredit".

I implore you to read the syntax references for these templating languages.
much of the facade of simplicity in a language become overwhelmed by more syntax
for features.

What you see is what you get in ClojureScript, and there aren't a lot of other
features that sneak up on you. It's all internally consistent.


We will see concrete examples from each language, but it is my opinion that
removal of delimiters pulls the proverbial rug out from under your feet.  What
you gained from simpler representation of your program's _structure_, you have
lost in the simplicity of your program's _semantics_, necessitating in the use
of extra syntax in what is a deceptively simple at first glance, but is often
wholly complex and non-composable in larger examples.  We explore this in detail
after the examples.

__[ClojureScript, indented]__ is purely a thought experiment that erases the
delimiters ([actually attempted here]).  Since it is already indented by
convention, this new form appears as an indentation-based language. So why
include the parentheses at all?

[actually attempted here]:https://github.com/boxed/indent-clj

```clojure
;; ClojureScript, delimiters removed
:div
  if imageSource
    :img {:src imageSource}
  for [m messages]
    :span m
```

We _convert this example_ to the most popular indented template languages next
to see its implications.
